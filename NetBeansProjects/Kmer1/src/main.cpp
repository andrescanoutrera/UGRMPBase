/**
 * This program reads from the stardard input, an integer n (number of 
 * elements in the list of pairs kmer-frequency) and a list of n pairs 
 * kmer-frequency. The pairs should be stored in an array (local variable 
 * in main() ), and then each one of the Kmers in the array must be 
 * normalized (all its characters are converted to uppercase
 * and invalid characters are replaced by the MISSING_NUCLEOTIDE character)
 * and zipped (those pairs with a missing nucleotide or with a 
 * frequency less or equals to zero must be deleted from the array). Next, 
 * the array should be sorted in decreasing 
 * order of frequency (if two pairs have the same frequency, the pair with a 
 * minor Kmer should appear first in the array). Finally, the program shows the 
 * array in the standard output. 
 * 
 * Running example:
 * > kmer1 < data/6pairsDNA_missing.k1in
