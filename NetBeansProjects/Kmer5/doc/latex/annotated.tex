Here are the classes, structs, unions and interfaces with brief descriptions\+:\begin{DoxyCompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{classKmer}{Kmer}} \\*It represents a list of k consecutive nucleotides of a DNA or RNA sequence. Each nucleotide is represented with a character like \textquotesingle{}A\textquotesingle{}, \textquotesingle{}C\textquotesingle{}, \textquotesingle{}G\textquotesingle{}, \textquotesingle{}T\textquotesingle{}, \textquotesingle{}U\textquotesingle{} }{\pageref{classKmer}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{classKmerCounter}{Kmer\+Counter}} \\*It is a helper class used to calculate the frequency of each kmer in a text file. It consists of a matrix of integers. Each element in the matrix contains the frequency of the kmer that is defined by its row and column\+: the kmer formed taking the nucleotides defined by the row and column of that element }{\pageref{classKmerCounter}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{classKmerFreq}{Kmer\+Freq}} \\*A pair formed by a \mbox{\hyperlink{classKmer}{Kmer}} object and a frequency (an int), that gives the frequency of a \mbox{\hyperlink{classKmer}{Kmer}} (times it appears) in a genoma }{\pageref{classKmerFreq}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{classProfile}{Profile}} \\*It defines a model (profile) for a given biological species. It contains a vector of pairs Kmer-\/frequency (objects of the class \mbox{\hyperlink{classKmerFreq}{Kmer\+Freq}}) and an identifier (string) of the profile }{\pageref{classProfile}}{}
