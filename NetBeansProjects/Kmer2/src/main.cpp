/**
 * This program reads and normalizes an undefined number of Profile objects 
 * from the input files passed as parameters to main(). These normalized Profile 
 * objects are used to obtain the union of them, the join Profile. The join 
 * Profile is then zipped (pairs with frequency less or equals to zero are 
 * deleted) and sorted by decreasing order of frequency. In that order,
 * if there is any tie in frequencies, then alphabetical order of kmers is
 * applied. Finally, the resulting sorted Profile is saved in the 
 * output file. 
 * The program must receive at least an input file and an output file. 
 * The output Profile will have as profile identifier, the one of the first 
 * input file (<file1.prf>). 
 * If an input file <file*.prf> has a profile identifier different from the one
 * of the first file (<file1.prf>), then it will not be included in the union. 
 * 
 * Running sintax:
 * > kmer2 <outputFile.prf> <file1.prf> [<file2.prf> ... <filen.prf>]  
 * 
 * Running example:
 * > kmer2 /tmp/outputFile.prf ../Genomes/5pairsRNA.prf ../Genomes/6pairsRNA.prf
 * 
 * > cat /tmp/outputFile.prf
