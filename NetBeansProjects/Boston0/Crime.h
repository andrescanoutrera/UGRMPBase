/**
 * @class Crime 
 * @brief It stores data about a crime occurred in Boston city between 
 * 2017-01-20 02:00:00 and 2022-02-02 00:00:00
 * The data of each crime comes from a csv file located in 
 * https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamnegi1993/boston-crime-dataset-2022/data
 * where some fields will be ignored.
 * 
 * The selected fields for a Crime are:
 * - 0  COUNTER: integer number that represents a counter that begins 
 *      from 0 for each year. 
 * - 1  IDENTIFIER_NUMBER: Identifier of the crime. It is an integer value 
 *      stored as a string, that is, like "0020". It is unique in a dataset of 
 *      crimes. The string for this field must contain at least one character
 *      different from whitespace and \t character. An ID will never contain
 *      leading or trailing blanks.
 * - 2  OFFENSE_CODE: string with an internal code whose group and description 
 *      come in the next two fields.
 * - 3  OFFENSE_CODE_GROUP: string with the group of the crime. 
 * - 4  OFFENSE_DESCRIPTION: string with the description of the crime.
 * - 5  DISTRICT: string with the district where the crime took place.
 * - 6  REPORTING_AREA: string with the area where the crime took place
 * - 7  SHOOTING: a boolean where true represents that the crime was caused by 
 *      a gunshot.
 * - 8  OCCURRED_ON_DATE: date and time when the crime took place. 
 * - 9  STREET: name of the street where it took place. 
 * - 10 LOCATION (latitud, longitude) where it took place. 

 * Example of a crime:
 * 2784,182102975,3820,Motor Vehicle Accident Response,M/V ACCIDENT INVOLVING PEDESTRIAN - INJURY,C6,175,0,2018-12-22 00:45:00,SOUTHAMPTON ST,42.331680,-71.067986 <br>
